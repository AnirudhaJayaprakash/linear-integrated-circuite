## Theory
A **MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor)** is a type of field-effect transistor (FET) that controls the flow of current using an electric field. MOSFETs are widely used in amplifier circuits due to their high input impedance and fast switching characteristics.

A **Common Source (CS) amplifier** is a basic MOSFET amplifier configuration where the source terminal is common to both input and output. It provides voltage gain and is used in various analog applications.


## Procedure

- **Gain = 6.11 dB**


## Calculation
Given:

Power (P) = 100 µW

Supply voltage (VDD) = 1.8V

Assume VDS = 0.6V (since VDS > VOV and VOV = 0.9 - 0.35)

Step 1: Calculating Drain Current (ID)

Using the power equation:
P = VDD × ID
Rearrange to find ID:
ID = P / VDD
Substituting values:ID = 100 µW / 1.8V = 55.55 µA

Step 2: Calculating Drain Resistance (RD)

Using Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law:
VDD = ID × RD + VDS
Rearrange to find RD:
RD = (VDD - VDS) / ID
Substituting values:
RD = (1.8V - 0.6V) / 55.55 µARD = 1.2V / 55.55 µA = 21.6 kΩ



## Tabular Column
| Width (W) (µm) | Drain Current (I<sub>D</sub>) (µA) | Channel Length (L) (nm) |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 1            | 78.7                 | 180             |
| 0.1          | 51.06                | 180             |
| 0.15         | 54.36                | 180             |
| 0.158        | 55                   | 180             |


## Results
1. The **DC analysis** determined the biasing conditions of the MOSFET, verifying that the operating point is correctly set with \( I_D \) = 55.5 µA.
2. So the qpoint whould be (0.61v,55µA)
3. The **Transient analysis** showed the time-domain response of the CS amplifier, confirming signal amplification.
4. The **AC analysis** revealed a voltage gain of **6.11 dB**.

## Inference
 Important Parameters of CS Amplifier:
- **Voltage Gain (Av):** Ratio of output voltage to input voltage.
- **Input Impedance (Zin):** Resistance seen at the input terminal.
- **Output Impedance (Zout):** Resistance seen at the output terminal.
- **Cutoff Frequency:** Frequency at which gain drops by 3 dB from its mid-band value.
- **Phase Shift:** The difference in phase between input and output signals.

 1. voltage devider circuit has been impimented so that we get stable q point.
 2. By increasing the width drain current increases.
 3. In an actual IC transistors are replace other passive components like resistor.

- **Gain = -2.195Db**

## Calculation
Given:

Power (P) = 100 µW

Supply voltage (VDD) = 1.8V

Assume VDS = 0.6V (since VDS > VOV and VOV = 0.9 - 0.35)

Calculating Drain Current (ID)

Using the power equation:
P = VDD × ID
Rearrange to find ID:
ID = P / VDD
Substituting values:
ID = 100 µW / 1.8V = 55.55 µA.
By trial and error we find for Id=55.5A and L=180nm for M1 transistor W=0.22 µm
And for the m2
L=180nm ; W=0.2 µm is kept constant.



## Results
1. The **DC analysis** determined the biasing conditions of the MOSFET, verifying that the operating point is correctly set with \( I_D \) = 55.5 µA.
2. So the qpoint whould be (0.3v,55µA)
3. The **Transient analysis** showed the time-domain response of the CS amplifier, confirming signal amplification.
4. The **AC analysis** revealed a voltage gain of **-2.195 dB**.

## Inference
1. comparing the 2 circuits we can see that the gain is decreased in the second circuit this is because change in qpoint.
2. The change in the qpoint is due to changing Rd to a cmosp transistor
